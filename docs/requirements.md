**Architecture**
We are going to develop a client-server model of our web application being deployed on a
reliable PaaS. End-Users get access to the
application via client-application (web-browser). On the server-side there is a web-server
program running all the time providing services to the client-side application.

**UI** : We will use **ReactJS** alongside other external libraries (if needed) to implement the User
Interface (consumer-face) side of the application. For styling our web applicationâ€™s view we
use a CSS-framework such as **Bootstrap** or Material-UI.

**Backend** : Possible technologies for implementing backend depends on our resources. We
may use _JavaScript running on Nodejs_ - platform with **Express-library** or Django with
python.
